//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,print a message to them. 
//The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names = ["uroosa", "safa", "bisma"];
for (var msg of names) {
  console.log("Assalamualaikum "+msg+"!\nHow are you.");
